            The post-war period in Japan was one of immense social change as Japanese society
            adjusted to the shock of
            defeat and to the occupation of Japan by American forces and their allies. Osamu Dazai’s <span
              class="word-emphasis"> The Setting Sun </span>
            takes
            this milieu as its background to tell the story of the decline of a minor aristocratic family.
          </span>
          <span class="book-description">
            The story is told through the eyes of Kazuko, the unmarried daughter of a widowed aristocrat. Her search for
            self meaning in a society devoid of use for her forms the crux of Dazai’s novel. It is a sad story, and
            structurally is a novel very much within the confines of the Japanese take on the novel in a way reminiscent
            of
            authors such as Nobel Prize winner Yasunari Kawabata – the social interactions are peripheral and
            understated,
            nuances must be drawn, and for readers more used to Western novelistic forms this comes across as being
            rather
            wishy-washy.

          <span class="book-description">
            Kazuko’s mother falls ill, and due to their financial circumstances they are forced to take a cottage in the
            countryside. Her brother, who became addicted to opium during the war is missing. When he returns, Kazuko
            attempts to form a liaison with the novelist Uehara. This romantic displacement only furthers to deepen her
            alienation from society.

            In Anthony Burgess's influential nightmare vision of the future, criminals take over after dark. Teen gang
            leader Alex narrates in fantastically inventive slang that echoes the violent intensity of youth rebelling
            against society. Dazzling and transgressive, A <span class="word-emphasis"> Clockwork Orange </span>is a
            frightening fable about good and evil
            and the meaning of human freedom. This edition includes the controversial last chapter not published in the
            first edition, and Burgess’s introduction, “A Clockwork Orange Resucked.”
